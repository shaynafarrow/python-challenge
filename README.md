# python-challenge
Main.py and financial_analysis.txt is for the first assignment

Pypolls.py and election_results.txt is for the second assignment

Please note when I downloaded the two csv files for each assignment some rows got deleted

Due to the deletion of rows my data doesn't look quite the same but it is close to the result screenshots given in the instructions

I was about to get both programs to run successfully!
